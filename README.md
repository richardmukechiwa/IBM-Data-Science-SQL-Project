# SpaceX SQL Data Analysis 

This repository contains the SQL scripts and a detailed PDF report of my analysis of SpaceX mission data. This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Specialization Certificate on Coursera.

## Project Overview

Using SQL, I analyzed SpaceX mission data to uncover trends and insights into payload performance, mission outcomes, and landing successes.

## Key Insights

- Identified unique launch sites and their contribution to SpaceX missions.
- Analyzed payloads carried by NASA (CRS) and other customers.
- Evaluated booster performance and landing outcomes for success patterns.
- Extracted the date of SpaceX's first successful landing on a ground pad.
- Summarized mission outcomes and landing performances between 2010-2017.
